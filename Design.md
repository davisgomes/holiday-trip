## Writing Style

### Tone & Voice Characteristics
- **Conversational**: Write as if speaking to a friend planning their dream vacation
- **Positive & Uplifting**: Focus on benefits and experiences, not just features
- **Specific & Concrete**: Use precise details rather than vague descriptions
- **Active Voice**: Keep sentences dynamic and engaging

### Word Choice
**Preferred Terms**:
- "Escape" instead of "vacation"
- "Experience" instead of "see"
- "Discover" instead of "find"
- "Pristine" for beaches
- "Authentic" for cultural experiences
- "Luxurious" for high-end amenities
- "Breathtaking" for views

**Avoid**:
- Clichés: "Paradise on earth," "tropical haven" (use sparingly)
- Negative language: "Don't miss," "can't wait"
- Jargon or overly technical terms
- Aggressive sales language: "Act now!" "Limited time!"

### Sentence Structure
- Vary sentence length for rhythm and engagement
- Use short, punchy sentences for impact
- Lead with benefits, follow with features
- Include sensory details: sounds of waves, taste of fresh seafood, feel of sand

### Example Passages

**Good Example**:
"Step onto powder-soft sand that stretches for miles along azure waters. Here in Barbados, your mornings begin with fresh papaya and steel drum melodies drifting from nearby cafés. Spend your days snorkeling among sea turtles, exploring historic plantations, or simply swaying in a hammock beneath swaying palms."

**Avoid**:
"Barbados is a great vacation destination with many beaches and activities. You can swim, snorkel, and visit historical sites. There are also good restaurants."
